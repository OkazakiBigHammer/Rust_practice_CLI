Oh crypto, oh crypto, what a craze you've become,
A digital creation, by some a treasure, by others a con.

Your value so volatile, it can soar and it can fall,
With headlines and tweets, driving us all up a wall.

Some say you're the future, a disruptor of the old,
A currency for all, that can't be bought or sold.

But others are wary, of your anonymous ways,
Of the risks and the dangers, that can leave us in a daze.

You may be a game-changer, or just a passing fad,
A technological wonder, or a bubble about to go bad.

Oh crypto, oh crypto, you leave us all perplexed,
A puzzle to be solved, or a mystery to be next.

Perhaps in time, we'll know your true worth,
And whether you're a blessing, or a curse on this earth.
